Dev Log 4:

I've created the final version in Unity for my game Sneak.
 
I was able to complete my main objectives from the proposal and personal
additions to the game. The only objective I did not complete was adding
additional obstacle to the game. I also edited the issue with the 
bar line counting down correctly. 

As for the update in general, I mainly focused on polishing the art, adding music,
and adding screen images for the player to see.
